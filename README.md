# Janzen-Connell Model

## Background

The Janzen-Connell Effect explains how herbivore pressure helps to sustain high
plant diversity levels, especially in tropical rain forests. It postulates that
high herbivore pressure will lead to high seedling mortality in the vicinity of
the mother plant, assuming that most herbivores are host-specific (as is the
case in most rainforest arthropods). Therefore, there will be a strong selection
pressure for longer-range seed dispersal to ensure low population densities for
each species. This prevents any one species from becoming dominant and thus
enables stable high diversity levels.

## Model description

- 32 tree species ('a'-'5')

- Tree traits:
  - growth rate
  - dispersal distance
  - herbivore resistance (?)
  
- Herbivore traits:
  - host species
  - dispersal distance
  
- Plant biomass changes with:
  - plant growth (size-dependent, positive)
  - herbivore feeding (density-dependent, negative)
  
- Main experiment: 
  - vary host specificity (1/2/4/8/16/32 hosts per herbivore)
  - measure tree species richness and average trait values
  
- Extended experiment:
  - allow tree traits to evolve
  - possibly also herbivore traits & per-host effectiveness
    (-> coevolution)
